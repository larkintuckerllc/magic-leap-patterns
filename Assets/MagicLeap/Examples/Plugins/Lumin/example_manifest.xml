<!--
Certain features require a privilege to be requested in the manifest. For the scenes that use these features, a custom manifest is needed
with the required privileges in the custom manifest. This file lists all the privileges that the various examples use. It can be left
as it is or modified by adding/trimming some of the extra privileges. The custom manifest should live in the Assets/Plugins/Lumin.
-->

<!--
Along with being in the manifest, certain privileges need to be requested at runtime as well:

PwFoundObjRead is a sensitive privilege and must be requested before the API that needs it is started.

CameraCapture and AudioCaptureMic are reality privileges and must be requested before the API that needs it is started
and every time the app regains focus, such as returning from a pause.

The examples that use these privileges demonstrate how this is done.
